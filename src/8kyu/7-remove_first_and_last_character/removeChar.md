# Remove First and Last Character

Complete the method that takes a boolean value and return a "Yes" string for true, or a "No" string for false. It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.
